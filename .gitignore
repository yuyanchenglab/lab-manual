# Not sure what a .gitignore is?
# See: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

# These are directly copied from Jekyll's first-party docs on `.gitignore` files:
# https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/#commit-to-source-control

# Ignore the default location of the built site, and caches and metadata generated by Jekyll
_site/
.sass-cache/
.jekyll-cache/
.jekyll-metadata

# Ignore folders generated by Bundler
.bundle/
vendor/

# .gitignore can't ignore committed files like Gemfile.lock
.DS_Store # Stupid MacOS
*.lock # Local computers have different configurations than Github

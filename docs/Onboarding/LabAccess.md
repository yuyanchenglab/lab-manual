## Building, Lab and Facility

This is our address:

    422 Curie Blvd
    3rd floor
    Stellar-Chance Laboratories
    Philadelphia, PA 19104

You can enter the building from almost any direction, and see details here: [Stellar Chance - Facilities](https://facilities.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/pennaccess/PA0027-StellarChance.pdf)

Exiting the elevators, the hallways form a square with office suites at 3 of the corners and a common area & conference room in the other corner. Diagonally across from that common area corner is Dr. Cheng's office in room 309C. Our lab is directly adjacent and is room 310. It is labelled with a sticker that says "The Coolest Laboratory on EARTH".

### Access

The floor outside of work hours, the building, and the lab each require card access. You should message Dr. Cheng with a photo of your PennCard with your PennCard number to grant you this access. She will Email Darren Johnson at [darrenj@pennmedicine.upenn.edu](darrenj@pennmedicine.upenn.edu) to request access to Stellar Chance, BRB, John Morgan, CRB entrances, and Stellar Chance's 3rd floor elevator lobby.

If you ever experience a lockout, you may go to security on the first floor of Stellar-Chance for assistance.

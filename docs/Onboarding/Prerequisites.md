## Permanent Staff

The general process for onboarding staff at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) can be found here: [Onboard@Penn](https://www.onboard.upenn.edu/)

This page is specifically for joining our lab as a researcher and catalogues any hitches that may not be explained through the above resource.

### Virtual Tasks: Part 1

After signing your offer letter, have your reference send a recommendation letter on your behalf, as this may take some time depending on your references' availability.

You will receive an email to approve a background check on you. If it takes more than a week to arrive, reach out to Dr. Cheng.

You will receive an email from noreply@upenn.edu to set up your PennKey (Penn username). Keep note of your Penn ID number featured at the end of the email.

Through the Penn Workday ([https://www.workday.upenn.edu/](https://www.workday.upenn.edu/)) website, submit your SSN and birthdate. Within the day, you should have a list of virtual paperwork to complete through Workday:

* Setting up my Pennkey 
* Demographic and Contact data 
* Part 1 of the I-9 
* Disability Self-Identification
* Payment Election Enrollment Event 
* Payroll Payment Acknowledgement 
* Preferred Name Changes 
* Personal Info Changes 
* Veteran Status Identification

Workday will also present you with other documents enumerating your employee rights that require acknowledgment to proceed.

### In-Person Task

Once the background check is complete, go to Onboard@Penn ([https://www.onboard.upenn.edu/](https://www.onboard.upenn.edu/)) to schedule an appointment to complete part 2 of the I-9 document. This appointment will require identifying documentation, but US citizens only require a passport as identification. The location is the second floor of the UPenn bookstore.

### Virtual Tasks: Part 2

When your Penn Email is accessible, `pennkey@upenn.edu`, request a PMACS account to work on the High Throughput Computing (HPC) cluster. The instructions are on the [HPC Wiki's Main Page->Accounts section](https://hpcwiki.pmacs.upenn.edu/index.php/HPC:Main_Page#Accounts). You should also bookmark this wiki as a useful resource. Use the following information to complete the Manager Information section:

```
Yuyan Cheng
305-778-6357
yuyan.cheng@pennmedicine.upenn.edu
PennKey: ChengYu
```

You should also be able begin your virtual Workday onboarding lessons. For this lab, wet or dry, HIPAA and blood/sharp exposure are necessary. Each lesson could last up to 30 minutes.

Your next responsibilities will become available to you on your offer letter's first day of employment.

### First Day Tasks

Get your PennCard at the card office neighboring the Onboard@Penn office in the bookstore. Any unfinished tasks on Workday (besides the lessons) or issues with your paperwork will require handling before getting your card.

Email a photo of your PennCard to Dr. Cheng to grant you building and lab access.

Penn will assign you virtual onboarding lessons. There are quite a few of them and may last several hours, covering a wide variety of topics about Penn itself and responsible conduct. There will be several CITI-training lessons for you.

Access the learning tab in the Workday menu, and input the module name into the search bar.
Click `More Categories` and then `Learning`, and open the training module.

Some training, such as the Hands-On Mouse training, will be an in-person course[^1]. To schedule a training session, utilize the link at the end of the prerequisite digital module to choose a date.

[^1]: The in-person training may take up to four hours. Plan accordingly.

You may receive a physical copy indicating the completion of the training. Provide it to Dr. Cheng, so she may add you to the appropriate protocols.

Postdocs share all the requirements needed by full-time staff. They are also required to upload proof of degree.

Postdocs will also receive an email from the Academics Programs Coordinator, currently Donna Crowley, about one required and one optional virtual orientation. They are hosted by The Office of Postdoctoral Affairs (OPA) and the Biomedical Postdoctoral Programs (BPP). The formal orientation is held each January and August/September. You are **required** to go to one of them, preferably the earliest one post-hire.

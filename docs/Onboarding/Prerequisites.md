## Permanent Staff

The general process for onboarding staff at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) can be found here: [Onboard@Penn](https://www.onboard.upenn.edu/)

This page is specifically for joining our lab as a researcher and catalogues any hitches that may not be explained through the above resource.

### Virtual Tasks: Part 1

After receiving the offer letter through email and signing it, there are a few tasks ahead of you.

The first is that you will need to contact your reference to send a recommendation letter on your behalf, as this may take some time depending on your references' availability.

You will eventually receive an email to approve a background check on you. If it takes more than a week to arrive, reach out to Dr. Cheng (yuyan.cheng@pennmedicine.upenn.edu) to investigate.

You will also shortly receive a prompt to set up your PennKey (Penn username). Choose wisely, as there is limited ability to change it in the future.

However, some tasks are immediately available to you. Through the Penn Workday ([https://www.workday.upenn.edu/](https://www.workday.upenn.edu/)) website, submit your SSN and birthdate. Within the day, you should have a list of virtual paperwork to complete through Workday:

* Setting up my Pennkey 
* Demographic and Contact data 
* Part 1 of the I-9 
* Disability Self-Identification
* Payment Election Enrollment Event 
* Payroll Payment Acknowledgement 
* Preferred Name Changes 
* Personal Info Changes 
* Veteran Status Identification

Workday will also present you with other documents enumerating your employee rights that require acknowledgment to proceed.

Once here, you wait for the results of the background check. Assuming everything is good, you may now go to Onboard@Penn ([https://www.onboard.upenn.edu/](https://www.onboard.upenn.edu/)) to schedule an appointment to complete part 2 of the I-9 document. This appointment will require identifying documentation, but US citizens only require a passport as identification.

### In-Person Tasks: Part 1

The Onboard@Penn appointment for completing your I-9 location will be on the second floor of the UPenn bookstore at:

    3601 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104

When you attend your appointment, remember that you will need documentation to identify yourself. If you are a US citizens, you may only be required to submit a passport.

### Virtual Tasks: Part 2

Request a Penn Medicine email account through the Penn Medicine website ([https://www.med.upenn.edu/pmacs/request-a-pennmedicine-email-account.html](https://www.med.upenn.edu/pmacs/request-a-pennmedicine-email-account.html)). Use Dr. Cheng's information as your manager:

```
Yuyan Cheng
305-778-6357
yuyan.cheng@pennmedicine.upenn.edu
PennKey: ChengYu
```

You or Dr. Cheng should receive an email with your new Penn Medicine email name and a temporary login. You should log into it through [idp.pennmedicine.upenn.edu](idp.pennmedicine.upenn.edu) and choose a more permanent password. That password will be distinct from your other accounts. Make sure to commit all of your password assignments to memory. After you set up your Penn medicine account, your pennkey@upenn.edu email will lose all information when your pennkey@pennmedicine.upenn.edu is added and all future email to pennkey@upenn.edu should forward to your Penn Medicine account.

From here, you can use your Penn Medicine email to request a PMACS account to work on the High Throughput Computing (HPC) cluster. The instructions are on the [HPC Wiki's Main Page->Accounts section](https://hpcwiki.pmacs.upenn.edu/index.php/HPC:Main_Page#Accounts). You should also bookmark this wiki as a useful resource.

You should also be able begin your virtual Workday onboarding lessons. For this lab, HIPPA and blood/sharp exposure are necessary. Each lesson could last up to 30 minutes.

Your next responsibilities will become available to you on your your offer letter's first day of employment.

### In-Person Tasks: Part 2

On your first day of official employment, you should go to the card office neighboring the Onboard@Penn office in the bookstore. Unless there are unfinished tasks on your Workday (besides the lessons) or you have paperwork that needs corrections, you should receive your PennCard.

Take a photo of your PennCard and email that picture to Dr. Cheng. She will use that to grant you access to our building. If you don't have your card for any reason, contact us and we will let you in.

### Onboarding Video Lessons

Begin the virtual onboarding video lessons. There are quite a few of them lasting several hours, and they cover a wide variety of topics about life at Penn and responsible conduct. Including the lessons available before your first day, there will be several CITI-training lessons for you.

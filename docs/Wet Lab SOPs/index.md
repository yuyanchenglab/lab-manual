Here we document the procedure to perform certain techniques in the wet lab.

## LabArchives

This will be either your lab notebook or a digital facsimile of your lab notebook. It will be used to track your work.

The purpose of this documentation is for:

* Troubleshooting: Knowing what you did on each step will give you a checklist of targets to tweak.
* Reproducibility: If your work needs to be double-checked or additional samples are needed, the details here ensure that the procedure is consistent.
* Followup: If a project is placed on the backburner, your notebook should be able to get you up to speed on the project's last known status.

After you sign up for lab archive, search your Emails in the following weeks for an Email from Lab Archives. It will have the senders address of info@e.labarchives.com and possibly assigned to an Amy Sutton. These are marketing emails and provide no opt-out through the website. The Email, however, will have a legally required unsubscribe button in the form of a text hyperlink labelled 'Click here to unsubscribe' in the Email footer. From there, unsubscribe from all of their Marketing Emails.

Make sure to click “save to page” before exiting document.

### ORGANIZATION

Some folders may already be present (e.g. protocols, experimental data, lab meeting notes, etc.).
Add folders as needed to keep lab notebook organized.

### PROTOCOLS

Write down all materials beforehand.
Write detailed steps for each procedure and update as necessary.
All changes are kept in a history, but for consistency with physical notebooks you should strikethrough incorrect information rather than deleting it.

Example:

### DAILY REPORTS 

Keep a record of EVERYTHING you do in the lab.
Each entry should include the goal, personnel, samples, and methods.
Make sure to include results and any analyses to get those results.
